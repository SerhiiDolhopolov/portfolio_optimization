Help me create an investment portfolio of stocks for companies from this list [{TICKERS}] with the goal to outperform the S&P500 index". Please make the portfolio as efficient as possible, finding a balance between risk and profit. In your answer, write only the list of stock tickers and the weight of the stocks in the portfolio, using this format:
ticker: weight
ticker: weight
ticker: weight

Do not write anything except the list of tickers and weights. Each weight must be >= 0 and <= 0.2, you can make weight 0, if you think that it will be better. The total weight of the {CARDINALITY} companies must be equal to 1. The weight must be in format 0.00, not percentage. In answer use all companies from this list [{TICKERS}]
